# PIFSC Data Report 
This repository includes the PIFSC Data Report template pieces used to create a
PIFSC Data Report for Cooperative Research TDRs.  

It's partly a test of using the template and partly an attempt to make it easier
for project members to offer edits without sending a bunch of Word docs back and
forth.
