# Background {.unnumbered}

Recently, Hawaiʻi’s longliners have expressed concerns about fluctuations in 
catch rates. Fish distribution, and in turn catch, is driven in part by ocean 
temperatures. Understanding how temperature varies over space and time, and how
this relates to the distribution and depth of fishing gear, can help commercial 
fishers better target their effort. However, these data are severely lacking 
across the footprint of Hawaiʻi’s longline fishery. Without information on the 
depths at which gear is fishing, it is impossible for PIFSC to thoroughly 
investigate longliners' concerns. While longline gear depth has been previously 
investigated (@Boggs1992, @Bigelow2006), operations have changed over time and 
revisiting this question is warranted. For example, NOAA Fisheries prohibited 
the use of wire leaders effective 31 May 2022 (@FR2022), which may have changed 
how gear behaves in the water.

This project aimed to help address this data gap and offer insight into 
questions that range from operational (depth of fishing gear) to ecological 
(thermal habitat), advancing both the interests of the longline industry and of 
NOAA Fisheries’ ecosystem-based management.

The temperature-depth recorder (TDR) data detailed in this report were collected 
in FY23 as part of an FY22 Cooperative Research project. This project was a 
partnership between the Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC), the 
Hawaii Longline Association (HLA), Poseidon Fisheries Research (PFR), and the 
captains and crew of the longline fishing vessels _Sea Hunt_ and _Marie M_. The 
TDR data were collected in service of one of the project goals, which was to 
determine the depths and temperatures at which longline gear is fishing.  

# Methodology {.unnumbered}
Data were collected with Star-Oddi DST centi-ex temperature-depth recorders. 
Sensors were deployed in a protective housing and clipped to the gear with a 
wire clip.  TDRs recorded at a 30-second resolution.

Two vessels, _Sea Hunt_ and _Marie M_, were partnered with for the project 
duration, which allowed for refining collection methods as well as consistency 
in methodology across the project’s lifetime. Data were collected from 24 trips 
over 12 months (October 2022 - September 2023). These 24 trips comprised roughly 
325 sets spanning the full footprint of Hawaiʻi’s deep-set longline fishery 
(@fig-1). Three TDRs were deployed per set, following the configuration in @fig-2.

# Data summary {.unnumbered}
A primary conclusion of this pilot project is that deep-set gear is being set 
shallower than it has been in the past (@fig-3; @Bigelow2006). Average maximum 
hook depth in our project was `r signif(avg_maxD$avgMaxDepth, 3)` m with the 
deepest set reaching `r signif(maxD_abs, 3)` m, whereas @Bigelow2006 recorded an 
average maximum hook depth of 244 m and maximum depth of 504 m. Given this 
shallower depth, gear is fishing at warmer temperatures than bigeye tuna’s 
preferred daytime thermal habitat of 8–14 °C (@fig-3; @Howell2010. Across all 
TDR positions, after removing set and haul periods when gear was moving 
vertically through the water column, `r signif(pct_abv14, 2)`% of observations 
recorded temperatures > 14 °C where bigeye tuna may be less likely to be present. 
Looking at specific TDR positions (@fig-2), nearly half 
(`r signif(deep_pct_abv14, 2)`%) of all observations from the deepest TDRs were 
above this thermal habitat threshold as were almost all mid-depth and shallow 
TDR observation (`r signif(mid_pct_abv14, 3)`% and `r signif(shal_pct_abv14, 3)`%,
respectively). Here, too, our results demonstrate a change from that observed by 
@Bigelow2006, who recorded an average minimum temperature of 12.6 °C and 
absolute minimum of 6.1 °C. Our results show an average minimum temperature of 
`r signif(avg_minT$avgMinTemp, 3)` °C and an absolute minimum of 
`r signif(minT_abs, 2)` °C. 

Understanding the depths and temperatures at which gear is fishing is crucial 
for determining how oceanographic conditions affect both catch and ecosystem 
composition. It is also essential for projecting climate impacts to our region’s 
most economically valuable commercial fishery.

# Next steps {.unnumbered}
Based on the results of this work, the Pelagic Research Program in PIFSC's 
Ecosystem Sciences Division is partnering with the Pacific Islands Regional 
Observer Program (PIROP) to conduct TDR sampling across the deep- and shallow-
set fisheries. These data are described in [data report reference here].
