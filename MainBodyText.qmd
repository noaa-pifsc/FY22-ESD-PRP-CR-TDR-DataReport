# Background {.unnumbered}

Recently, Hawaiʻi’s longliners have expressed concerns about fluctuations in 
catch rates. Fish distribution, and in turn catch, is driven in part by ocean 
temperatures. Understanding how temperature varies over space and time, and how
this relates to the distribution and depth of fishing gear can help commercial 
fishers better target their effort. However, these data are severely lacking 
across the footprint of Hawaiʻi’s longline fishery. Without information on the 
depths at which gear is fishing, it is impossible for PIFSC to thoroughly 
investigate longliners' concerns. While longline gear depth has been previously 
investigated (@Boggs1992, @Bigelow2006), operations have changed over time and 
revisiting this question is warranted. For example, NOAA Fisheries prohibited 
the use of wire leaders effective 31 May 2022 (@FR2022), which may have changed 
how gear behaves in the water.

This project aimed to help address this data gap and offer insight into 
questions that range from operational (depth of fishing gear) to ecological 
(thermal habitat), advancing both the interests of the longline industry and of 
NOAA Fisheries’ ecosystem-based management.

The temperature-depth recorder (TDR) data detailed in this report were collected 
in FY23 as part of an FY22 Cooperative Research project. This project was a 
partnership between the Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC), the 
Hawaii Longline Association (HLA), Poseidon Fisheries Research (PFR), and the 
captains and crew of the longline fishing vessels _Sea Hunt_ and _Marie M_. The 
TDR data were collected in service of one of the project goals, which was to 
determine the depths and temperatures at which longline gear is fishing.  

# Methodology
Data were collected with Star-Oddi DST centi-ex temperature-depth recorders. 
Sensors were deployed in a protective housing and clipped to the gear with a 
wire clip.

Two vessels, _Sea Hunt_ and _Marie M_, were partnered with for the project 
duration, which allowed for refining collection methods as well as consistency 
in methodology across the project’s lifetime. Data were collected from 24 trips 
over 12 months (October 2022 - September 2023). These 24 trips comprised roughly 
325 sets spanning the full footprint of Hawaiʻi’s deep-set longline fishery 
(@fig-1). Three TDRs were deployed per set, following the configuration in @fig-2.

# Data summary

# Next steps
Based on the results of this work, the Pelagic Research Program in PIFSC's 
Ecosystem Sciencies Division is partnering with the Pacific Islands Regional 
Observer Program (PIROP) to conduct TDR sampling cross the deep- and shallow-
set fisheries. These data are described in [data report reference here].
