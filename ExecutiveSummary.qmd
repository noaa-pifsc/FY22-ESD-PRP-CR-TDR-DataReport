# Executive Summary {.unnumbered}

These data were collected as part of a Cooperative Research 
partnership between the Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC), 
the Hawaii Longline Association (HLA), Poseidon Fisheries Research (PFR), and 
the captains and crew of the longline fishing vessels _Sea Hunt_ and _Marie M_. 
One of the project goals was to determine the depths and temperatures at which 
longline gear is fishing. 

This data report describes the temperature-depth recorder (TDR) data collected. 
Data were collected from 24 trips over 12 months (October 2022 – September 
2023). These 24 trips comprised roughly 325 sets spanning the full footprint of 
Hawaiʻi’s deep-set longline fishery. Three TDRs were deployed per set and 
spanned the depth range of the gear.  

A primary conclusion of this work is that deep-set gear is being set shallower 
than it has been in the past. As a result, gear is fishing at warmer 
temperatures than bigeye tuna’s preferred daytime thermal habitat. As a result 
of these results, and building on this project's success, the Pelagic Research 
Program moved ahead with supplying TDRs to NOAA's Pacific Islands Regional 
Observer Program (PIROP) for deployment across the deep-set fishery. This will 
make it possible to determine whether these pilot data are representative of the 
fleet as a whole. 

Data collected through the ongoing TDR deployment in partnership with PIROP is 
detailed in [data report reference here].
